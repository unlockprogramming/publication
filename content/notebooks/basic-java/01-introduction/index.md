## Java Programming Language

Java is a high-level programming language, meaning that it is easier to read and write compared to low-level languages, which are closer to machine code. It is also statically typed, meaning that variables must be declared before they can be used and their type (e.g., string, integer, etc.) must be specified.

## History of Java

Java was developed by James Gosling and a team of developers at Sun Microsystems in the early 1990s. The language was initially called Oak, but was later renamed to Java in 1995. It was released as a part of the Java platform, which included a virtual machine, development tools, and libraries for building applications.

In 2010, Oracle Corporation acquired Sun Microsystems and now maintains and develops Java.

## Why Java?

There are several reasons why Java is a popular programming language:

* Write once, run anywhere (WORA): Java code is compiled into a machine-independent bytecode, which means that it can run on any device that has a Java Virtual Machine (JVM) installed.

* Object-oriented: Java is an object-oriented language, that makes it easy to create modular, reusable code and helps developers to organize and structure their code in a logical and intuitive way.

* Robust and secure: Java provides features such as automatic memory management, exception handling, and type checking. This makes it a reliable choice for building applications that need to be secure and stable.

* Large standard library: Java has a large and comprehensive standard library, which provides a wide range of functions and utilities. This makes it easier for developers to implement common tasks and helps them to avoid reinventing the wheel.

* Widely used: Java is a widely used programming language, with a large developer community and a vast amount of resources and documentation available online. This makes it easier for developers to find help and support when they need it.

## JDK vs JRE

* Java Development Kit (JDK) is a software development kit that includes tools for developing Java applications. It includes a Java compiler, a Java Virtual Machine (JVM), and other tools and libraries that are needed for developing Java applications.
* Java Runtime Environment (JRE) is a software package that provides a runtime environment in which Java applications can be executed. It includes a JVM and the necessary libraries and resources for running Java applications, but it does not include the tools and libraries that are needed for developing Java applications.
